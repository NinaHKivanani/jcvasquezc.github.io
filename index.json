The automatic assessment of speech signals is promising for the evaluation of the neurological state and the speech quality of the patients. Recently, progress has been made in applying machine learning and computational methods to automatically evaluate the speech of PD patients. In the present study, we plan to analyze the speech signals of PD patients and healthy control (HC) subjects in three different languages: German, Spanish, and Czech, with the aim to identify biomarkers to discriminate between PD patients and HC subjects and to evaluate the neurological state of the patients. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is the automatic classification of PD patients and HC subjects in different languages with focusing on phonation, articulation, and prosody. We will focus on an intelligibility analysis based on automatic speech recognition systems trained on these three languages. This is one of the first studies done that considers the evaluation of the speech of PD patients in different languages. The purpose of this research proposal is to build a model that can discriminate PD and HC subjects even when the language used for train and test is different.","tags":null,"title":"Automated Cross-language Intelligibility Analysis of Parkinson’s Disease Patients Using Speech Recognition Technologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Arias Vergara","S Gollwitzer","JR Orozco-Arroyave","JC Vasquez-Correa","E Nöth","C Högerle","M Schuster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2dd72230ad8ddbe0ef803d1e4a830b4a","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vergara-2019-speech/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.789256Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vergara-2019-speech/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Speech differences between CI users with pre-and postlingual onset of deafness detected by speech processing methods on voiceless to voice transitions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paula Andrea Pérez-Toro","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Tomas Arias-Vergara","Nicanor Garcia-Ospina","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0a2c2d70e399e6853d86d0f1241f74df","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/perez-2018-non/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.36554Z","relpermalink":"/publication/perez-2018-non/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Non-linear Dynamics Approach to Classify Gait Signals of Patients with Parkinson’s Disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Felipe Parra-Gallego","Tomás Arias-Vergara","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Nicanor Garcia-Ospina","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"89873c00479ee7dbb7c858e217fb064b","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/parra-2018-automatic/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.789977Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parra-2018-automatic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Intelligibility Assessment of Parkinson’s Disease with Diadochokinetic Exercises","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicanor Garcia","Juan Camilo-Vásquez Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"fc3923d14f5147646e45d19030aaa0ce","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/garcia-2018-multimodal/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.790691Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2018-multimodal/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor symptoms.

Additionally, the progression of those symptoms also differs among patients. Most of the studies on the analysis of speech of people with Parkinson’s disease do not consider such an individual variation. This paper presents a methodology for the automatic and individual monitoring of speech disorders developed by PD patients. The neurological state and dysarthria level of the patients are evaluated. The proposed system is based on individual speaker models which are created for each patient. Two different models are evaluated, the classical GMM–UBM and the i–vectors approach. These two methods are compared with respect to a baseline found with a traditional Support Vector Regressor. Different speech aspects (phonation, articulation, and prosody) are considered to model recordings of spontaneous speech and a read text. A multi-aspect coefficient is proposed with the aim of incorporating information from all of these speech aspects into a single measure. Two different scenarios are considered to assess a set with seven PD patients: (1) the longitudinal test set which consists of speech recordings captured in five recording sessions distributed from 2012 to 2016, and (2) the at-home test set which consists of speech recordings captured in the home of the same seven patients during 4 months (one day per month, four times per day). The UBM is trained with the recordings of 100 speakers (50 with Parkinson’s disease and 50 healthy speakers) captured with controlled acoustic conditions and a professional audio-setting. With the aim of evaluating the suitability of the proposed approaches and the possibility of extending this kind of systems to remotely assess the speech of the patients, a total of five different communication channels (sound-proof booth, Skype®, Hangouts®, mobile phone, and land-line) are considered to train and test the system. Due to the reduced number of recording sessions in the longitudinal test set, the experiments that involved this set are evaluated with the Pearson’s correlation. The experiments with the at-home test set are evaluated with the Spearman’s correlation. The results estimating the dysarthria level of the patients in the at-home test set indicate a correlation of 0.55 with a modified version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment scale when the GMM-UBM model is applied upon the Skype® recordings. The results in the longitudinal test set indicate a correlation of 0.77 using a model based on i-vectors with recordings captured in the sound-proof-booth. The evaluation of the neurological state of the patients in the longitudinal test set shows correlations of up to 0.55 with the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale also using models based on i-vectors created with Skype® recordings. These results suggest that the i–vector approach is suitable when the acoustic conditions among recording sessions differ (longitudinal test set). The GMM-UBM approach seems to be more suitable when the acoustic conditions do not change a lot among recording sessions (at-home test set). Particularly, the best results were obtained with the Skype® calls, which can be explained due to several preprocessing stages that this codec applies to the audio signals. In general, the results suggest that the proposed approaches are suitable for tele-monitoring the dysarthria level and the neurological state of PD patients","tags":null,"title":"Speaker models for monitoring Parkinson’s disease progression considering different communication channels and acoustic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JC Vásquez-Correa","JR Orozco-Arroyave","T Bocklet","E Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"88f859ee9aafa4d2837fc0c5b27cecaa","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2018-towards/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.362902Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2018-towards/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Towards an automatic evaluation of the dysarthria level of patients with Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Arias-Vergara","Juan Camilo Vasquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Philipp Klumpp","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5d3c1e9df918aa3d2b56678903e5d982","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/arias-2018-unobtrusive/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.786491Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arias-2018-unobtrusive/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinson's disease (PD) produces several speech impairments in the patients.

The application consists of four major parts. There is a phone call detection which triggers the whole processing chain. Secondly, there is the phone call recording which has proven to be more challenging than expected. The signal analysis, another crucial component, is still in development for the phone call analysis. Additionally, the application collects several pieces of meta information about the calls to put the results into deeper context. After describing how the speech signal is affected by Parkinson’s disease, we sketch the overall application architecture and explain the four major parts of the current implementation in further detail.

Specifically, impacted phonation and articulation causes the patient to have a breathy, husky-semiwhisper and hoarse voice. A goal of this paper is to characterise a VQ spectrum – the composition of non-modal phonations – of voice in PD. The paper relates non-modal healthy phonations: breathy, creaky, tense, falsetto and harsh, with disordered phonation in PD. First, statistics are learned to differentiate the modal and non-modal phonations. Statistics are computed using phonological posteriors, the probabilities of phonological features inferred from the speech signal using a deep learning approach. Second, statistics of disordered speech are learned from PD speech data comprising 50 patients and 50 healthy controls. Third, Euclidean distance is used to calculate similarity of non-modal and disordered statistics, and the inverse of the distances is used to obtain the composition of non-modal phonation in PD. Thus, pathological voice quality is characterised using healthy non-modal voice quality “base/eigenspace”. The obtained results are interpreted as the voice of an average patient with PD and can be characterised by the voice quality spectrum composed of 30% breathy voice, 23% creaky voice, 20% tense voice, 15% falsetto voice and 12% harsh voice. In addition, the proposed features were applied for prediction of the dysarthria level according to the Frenchay assessment score related to the larynx, and significant improvement is obtained for reading speech task. The proposed characterisation of VQ might also be applied to other kinds of pathological speech.","tags":null,"title":"Characterisation of voice quality of Parkinson’s disease using differential phonological posterior features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"35cd781242b4f849fceaa0746d5e05b6","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2017-convolutional/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.361025Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2017-convolutional/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Convolutional Neural Network to Model Articulation Impairments in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","J Serra","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"0e18e96fbd3c9c35db9529363905d0b1","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2017-effect/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.361966Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2017-effect/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Effect of acoustic conditions on algorithms to detect Parkinson's disease from speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicanor Garcia","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Najim Dehak","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"5c938d2f6d4017d1029c04ba7a976ae0","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/garcia-2017-language/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.787039Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2017-language/","section":"publication","summary":"Speech disorders are among the most common symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease.

In this study, a cross-language experiment is performed to evaluate the motor impairments of the patients in three different languages: Czech, German and Spanish. The i-vector approach is used for the evaluation due to its capability to model speaker traits. The cosine distance between the i-vector of a test speaker and a reference i-vector that represents either healthy controls or patients is computed. This distance is used to perform two analyses: classification between patients and healthy speakers, and the prediction of the neurological state of the patients according to the MDS-UPDRS score. Classification accuracies of up to 72% and Spearman’s correlations of up to 0.41 are obtained between the cosine distance and the MDS-UPDRS score.

There is interest in the research community to study acoustic measures that provide objective information to model PD speech. Although there are several studies in the literature that consider different characteristics of Parkinson’s speech like phonation and articulation, there are no studies including the aging process as another possible source of impairments in speech. The aim of this work is to analyze the vowel articulation and phonation of Parkinson’s patients compared with respect to two groups of healthy people: (1) young speakers with ages ranging from 22 to 50 years and (2) people with ages matched with respect to the Parkinson’s patients. Each participant repeated the sustained phonation of the five Spanish vowels three times and those utterances per speaker are modeled by using phonation and articulation features. Feature selection is applied to eliminate redundant information in the features space, and the automatic discrimination of the three groups of speakers is performed using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) following a one vs. all strategy, speaker independent. The results are compared to those obtained using a cognitive-inspired classifier which is based on neural networks (NN). The results indicate that the phonation and articulation capabilities of young speakers clearly differ from those exhibited by the elderly speakers (with and without PD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper introducing experimental evidence to support the fact that age matching is necessary to perform more accurate and robust evaluations of pathological speech signals, especially considering diseases suffered by elderly people, like Parkinson’s. Additionally, the comparison among groups of speakers at different ages is necessary in order to understand the natural change in speech due to the aging process.","tags":null,"title":"Parkinson's disease and aging: analysis of their effect in phonation and articulation of speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Jiménez-Monsalve","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Pedro Gomez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"eca1ff7d1138cb7199d1491d294ce707","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/jimenez-2017-phonation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.787436Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jimenez-2017-phonation/","section":"publication","summary":"This study considers phonation and articulation measures to model voice disorders produced by three different pathologies: Laryngeal pathologies (LP), cleft lip and palate (CLP), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Different speech tasks are considered including sustained vowel phonations, isolated words, and read texts. The obtained accuracies, in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), range between 55.7 and 99.2 depending on the pathology. The results suggest that phonation features are appropriate to model LP; however, for the case of CLP and PD, it seems like the articulation measures provide more information about the problems in moving and controlling the articulators of the vocal tract.

First one is based on classical features such as pitch period perturbations, noise measures, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Second is based on the non-linear dynamics (NLD) analysis. The most relevant features are selected and sorted according to two techniques: principal components analysis (PCA), and sequential floating feature selection (SFFS). The decision about whether a voice record is hypernasal or healthy is taken using a soft margin - support vector machine (SM-SVM). The experiments are carried out using recordings of the five Spanish vowels and the words /coco/ and /gato/, considering three different set of features: (1) the classical approach, (2) the NLD analysis, and (3) the combination of the classical and NLD measures. In general, the accuracy rates are higher and more stable when the classical and NLD features are combined into the same feature space, indicating that the NLD analysis is a complement for the classical approach.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic detection of hypernasal speech of children with cleft lip and palate from spanish vowels and words using classical measures and nonlinear analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez Correa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"153ab4f1159f1eacb9e05f7dd10d1f04","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2016-emotion/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.788208Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2016-emotion/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Emotion recognition from speech with acoustic, non-linear and wavelet-based features extracted in different acoustic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Arias-Vergara","Juan Camilo Vasquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Jesus Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Tino Haderlein","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"a1b335eac1885886d0431600f084fdb5","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/arias-2016-gender/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.36423Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arias-2016-gender/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinson’s disease (PD) severity is evaluated by neurologist experts by means of several tests.

Some of the most relevant proposed applications of it are in call-centers. In these scenarios the speech is distorted by compression algorithms. The effects of such distortion on the performance of systems for automatic recognition of emotions must be assessed. In this study these effects are evaluated independently of any other distortions generated by the communications channel. Several state-of-the-art codecs are used to compress the speech signals of two emotional speech databases. The databases used are the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech and the enterface05. The methodology considers voiced and unvoiced segments of the speech separately. Spectral, cepstral, noise and Non-Linear Dynamics (NLD) measures are used to characterize the segments. Finally, a classifier based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to identify the emotion. The results indicate that voiced segments are less affected by the compression than unvoiced ones in terms in classification accuracy. They also show that the bandwidth of the analyzed signals is an important factor in the classification results.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic emotion recognition in compressed speech using acoustic and non-linear features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Nicanor Garcı́a","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"bcfe1a1d89bc5c95c3ec359e528dddb9","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2015-emotion/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.360692Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2015-emotion/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Emotion recognition from speech under environmental noise conditions using wavelet decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián D Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","LD Avendaño","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"0bbbba9fb117f660bc63f8cc01d2d238","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2015-time/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.788536Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2015-time/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Time dependent ARMA for automatic recognition of fear-type emotions in speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicanor Garcı́a","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Jesus Francisco Várgas-Bonilla","Julian David Arias-Londono","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"6ed4a870302e1a425c3e627f0dd09699","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/garcia-2014-evaluation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.791478Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2014-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"The estimation of the fundamental frequency (F0) in speech is a very important task that has been addressed by many researchers. F0 estimation can be used to separate two kind of frames from an utterance, those where the vocal folds vibrate (voiced sounds) and those where not (unvoiced sounds). The methods used to estimate F0 are affected by the presence of additive noise in recordings made in non-controlled environments, however, there are different techniques to mitigate the effect of such noise and Speech Enhancement (SE) has proven to be one of the most effective ones. This article presents results of the evaluation of the effects of noise and SE algorithms on the detection of F0 and the signal segmentation in voiced/unvoiced segments. We performed experiments with signals artificially contaminated with two different kinds of noise, White Gaussian Noise (WGN) and background noise recorded at a cafeteria (Cafeteria babble), subsequently, the signals are processed with SE algorithms of four different classes: Wiener Filter, Spectral Subtraction, Statistical-Model Based and Sub-space algorithms. Two different kind of error metrics are considered: Gross Pitch Error and Voicing Determination Error. The results show that only the sub-space approach improves the performance in the detection of F0 and the signal segmentation in voiced/unvoicd segments.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of the effects of speech enhancement algorithms on the detection of fundamental frequency of speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Nicanor Garcı́a","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","MO Lucia Quintero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"c8962d3a43c09ade58ab6fdcd5fc7cb1","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2014-evaluation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.361329Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2014-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of wavelet measures on automatic detection of emotion in noisy and telephony speech signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas Bonilla","Elmar Noth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"eac1987cf736406509a439a47d3e8d9c","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2014-new/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.357808Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2014-new/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"New computer aided device for real time analysis of speech of people with Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JC Vásquez-Correa","JR Orozco-Arroyave","JD Arias-Londono","JF Vargas-Bonilla","E Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b428f51d82f9f313cafb9b2239d7180d","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2013-design/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.364887Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2013-design/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Design and implementation of an embedded system for real time analysis of speech from people with parkinson's disease","type":"publication"}]
