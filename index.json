Impairments in handwriting are among the main symptoms of the disease. Handwriting analysis can help in supporting the diagnosis and in monitoring the progress of the disease. This paper aims to evaluate the importance of different groups of features to model handwriting deficits that appear due to Parkinson’s disease; and how those features are able to discriminate between Parkinson’s disease patients and healthy subjects. Methods: Features based on kinematic, geometrical and non-linear dynamics analyses were evaluated to classify Parkinson’s disease and healthy subjects. Classifiers based on K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random forest were considered. Results: Accuracies of up to 93.1% were obtained in the classification of patients and healthy control subjects. A relevance analysis of the features indicated that those related to speed, acceleration, and pressure are the most discriminant. The automatic classification of patients in different stages of the disease shows κ indexes between 0.36 and 0.44. Accuracies of up to 83.3% were obtained in a different dataset used only for validation purposes.Conclusions: The results confirmed the negative impact of aging in the classification process when we considered different groups of healthy subjects.

The current version of NeuroSpeech was developed to model dysarthric speech signals from people with Parkinson's disease; however, the structure of the software allows other computer scientists or developers to include other pathologies and/or other measures in order to complement the existing options. Three different tasks can be performed with the current version of the software: (1) the modeling of the speech recordings considering the aforementioned speech dimensions, (2) the automatic discrimination of Parkinson's vs. non-Parkinson's speech signals (if the user has access to recordings of other pathologies, he/she can re-train the system to perform the detection of other diseases), and (3) the prediction of the neurological state of the patient according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. The prediction of the dysarthria level according to the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment scale is also provided (the user can also train the system to perform the prediction of other kind of scales or degrees of severity). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first software with the characteristics described above, and we consider that it will help other researchers to contribute to the state-of-the-art in pathological speech assessment from different perspectives, e.g., from the clinical point of view for interpretation, and from the computer science point of view enabling the test of different measures and pattern recognition techniques.","tags":null,"title":"NeuroSpeech: An open-source software for Parkinson's speech analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicanor Garcia-Ospina","Tomas Arias-Vergara","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Milos Cernak","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"bc92aa0da6380662407d391277523bb9","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/garcia-2018-phonological/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.790341Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2018-phonological/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Phonological i-Vectors to Detect Parkinson's Disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlon Estiben Bedoya-Vargas","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"58741cc5fa018a389db50be8ec8a4f0d","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/bedoya-2018-representaciones/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.789627Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bedoya-2018-representaciones/","section":"publication","summary":"La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es un desorden neurodegenerativo del sistema nervioso central, cuyas características principales incluyen entre otras la rigidez, bradicinesia y pérdida de los reflejos posturales.

Additionally, the progression of those symptoms also differs among patients. Most of the studies on the analysis of speech of people with Parkinson’s disease do not consider such an individual variation. This paper presents a methodology for the automatic and individual monitoring of speech disorders developed by PD patients. The neurological state and dysarthria level of the patients are evaluated. The proposed system is based on individual speaker models which are created for each patient. Two different models are evaluated, the classical GMM–UBM and the i–vectors approach. These two methods are compared with respect to a baseline found with a traditional Support Vector Regressor. Different speech aspects (phonation, articulation, and prosody) are considered to model recordings of spontaneous speech and a read text. A multi-aspect coefficient is proposed with the aim of incorporating information from all of these speech aspects into a single measure. Two different scenarios are considered to assess a set with seven PD patients: (1) the longitudinal test set which consists of speech recordings captured in five recording sessions distributed from 2012 to 2016, and (2) the at-home test set which consists of speech recordings captured in the home of the same seven patients during 4 months (one day per month, four times per day). The UBM is trained with the recordings of 100 speakers (50 with Parkinson’s disease and 50 healthy speakers) captured with controlled acoustic conditions and a professional audio-setting. With the aim of evaluating the suitability of the proposed approaches and the possibility of extending this kind of systems to remotely assess the speech of the patients, a total of five different communication channels (sound-proof booth, Skype®, Hangouts®, mobile phone, and land-line) are considered to train and test the system. Due to the reduced number of recording sessions in the longitudinal test set, the experiments that involved this set are evaluated with the Pearson’s correlation. The experiments with the at-home test set are evaluated with the Spearman’s correlation. The results estimating the dysarthria level of the patients in the at-home test set indicate a correlation of 0.55 with a modified version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment scale when the GMM-UBM model is applied upon the Skype® recordings. The results in the longitudinal test set indicate a correlation of 0.77 using a model based on i-vectors with recordings captured in the sound-proof-booth. The evaluation of the neurological state of the patients in the longitudinal test set shows correlations of up to 0.55 with the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale also using models based on i-vectors created with Skype® recordings. These results suggest that the i–vector approach is suitable when the acoustic conditions among recording sessions differ (longitudinal test set). The GMM-UBM approach seems to be more suitable when the acoustic conditions do not change a lot among recording sessions (at-home test set). Particularly, the best results were obtained with the Skype® calls, which can be explained due to several preprocessing stages that this codec applies to the audio signals. In general, the results suggest that the proposed approaches are suitable for tele-monitoring the dysarthria level and the neurological state of PD patients","tags":null,"title":"Speaker models for monitoring Parkinson’s disease progression considering different communication channels and acoustic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Tobias Bocklet","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"88f859ee9aafa4d2837fc0c5b27cecaa","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2018-towards/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.362902Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2018-towards/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder that produces motor and non-motor impairments. The evaluation of motor symptoms is currently performed following the third section of the Movement Disorder Society – Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III); however, only one item of that scale is related to speech impairments. It is necessary to develop a specific scale such that considers those aspects related to speech impairments of the patients.Aims: (i) To introduce and evaluate the suitability of a modified version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (m-FDA) scale to quantify the dysarthria level of PD patients; (ii) to objectively model dysarthric speech signals considering four speech dimensions; (iii) to develop a methodology, based on speech processing and machine learning methods, to automatically quantify/predict the dysarthria level of patients with PD.Methods: The speech recordings are modeled using features extracted from several dimensions of speech: phonation, articulation, prosody, and intelligibility. The dysarthria level is quantified using linear and non-linear regression models. Speaker models based on i-vectors are also explored.Result and conclusion: The m-FDA scale was introduced to assess the dysarthria level of patients with PD. Articulation features extracted from continuous speech signals to create i-vectors were the most accurate to quantify the dysarthria level, with correlations of up to 0.69 between the predicted m-FDA scores and those assigned by the phoniatricians. When the dysarthria levels were estimated considering dedicated speech exercises such as rapid repetition of syllables (DDKs) and read texts, the correlations were 0.64 and 0.57, respectively. In addition, the combination of several feature sets and speech tasks improved the results, which validates the hypothesis about the contribution of information from different tasks and feature sets when assessing dysarthric speech signals. The speaker models seem to be promising to perform individual modeling for monitoring the dysarthria level of PD patients. The proposed approach may help clinicians to make more accurate and timely decisions about the evaluation and therapy associated to the dysarthria level of patients. The proposed approach is a great step towards unobtrusive/ecological evaluations of patients with dysarthric speech without the need of attending medical appointments.","tags":null,"title":"Towards an automatic evaluation of the dysarthria level of patients with Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Arias-Vergara","Juan Camilo Vasquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Philipp Klumpp","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5d3c1e9df918aa3d2b56678903e5d982","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/arias-2018-unobtrusive/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.786491Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arias-2018-unobtrusive/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinson's disease (PD) produces several speech impairments in the patients.

By unobtrusively analyzing the speech signal during phone calls and with a dedicated speech test, we want to be able to determine the severity and the progression of Parkinson’s disease for a patient much more frequently than it would be possible with regular check-ups. The application consists of four major parts. There is a phone call detection which triggers the whole processing chain. Secondly, there is the phone call recording which has proven to be more challenging than expected. The signal analysis, another crucial component, is still in development for the phone call analysis. Additionally, the application collects several pieces of meta information about the calls to put the results into deeper context. After describing how the speech signal is affected by Parkinson’s disease, we sketch the overall application architecture and explain the four major parts of the current implementation in further detail. We then present the promising results achieved with the first version of a dedicated speech test. In the end, we outline how the project could receive further improvements in the future.

Specifically, impacted phonation and articulation causes the patient to have a breathy, husky-semiwhisper and hoarse voice. A goal of this paper is to characterise a VQ spectrum – the composition of non-modal phonations – of voice in PD. The paper relates non-modal healthy phonations: breathy, creaky, tense, falsetto and harsh, with disordered phonation in PD. First, statistics are learned to differentiate the modal and non-modal phonations. Statistics are computed using phonological posteriors, the probabilities of phonological features inferred from the speech signal using a deep learning approach. Second, statistics of disordered speech are learned from PD speech data comprising 50 patients and 50 healthy controls. Third, Euclidean distance is used to calculate similarity of non-modal and disordered statistics, and the inverse of the distances is used to obtain the composition of non-modal phonation in PD. Thus, pathological voice quality is characterised using healthy non-modal voice quality “base/eigenspace”. The obtained results are interpreted as the voice of an average patient with PD and can be characterised by the voice quality spectrum composed of 30% breathy voice, 23% creaky voice, 20% tense voice, 15% falsetto voice and 12% harsh voice. In addition, the proposed features were applied for prediction of the dysarthria level according to the Frenchay assessment score related to the larynx, and significant improvement is obtained for reading speech task. The proposed characterisation of VQ might also be applied to other kinds of pathological speech.","tags":null,"title":"Characterisation of voice quality of Parkinson’s disease using differential phonological posterior features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"35cd781242b4f849fceaa0746d5e05b6","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2017-convolutional/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.361025Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2017-convolutional/","section":"publication","summary":"Speech impairments are one of the earliest manifestations in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Particularly, articulation deficits related to the capability of the speaker to start/stop the vibration of the vocal folds have been observed in the patients. Those difficulties can be assessed by modeling the transitions between voiced and unvoiced segments from speech. A robust strategy to model the articulatory deficits related to the starting or stopping vibration of the vocal folds is proposed in this study. The transitions between voiced and unvoiced segments are modeled by a convolutional neural network that extracts suitable information from two time-frequency representations: the short time Fourier transform and the continuous wavelet transform. The proposed approach improves the results previously reported in the literature. Accuracies of up to 89% are obtained for the classification of Parkinson’s patients vs. healthy speakers.

In this paper, the effects on the accuracy of five different methods to detect PD from speech are evaluated. Among the considered conditions, background noise produces the worst effect, while dynamic compression or some speech codecs can even have a marginal positive impact.

There is interest in the research community to study acoustic measures that provide objective information to model PD speech. Although there are several studies in the literature that consider different characteristics of Parkinson’s speech like phonation and articulation, there are no studies including the aging process as another possible source of impairments in speech. The aim of this work is to analyze the vowel articulation and phonation of Parkinson’s patients compared with respect to two groups of healthy people: (1) young speakers with ages ranging from 22 to 50 years and (2) people with ages matched with respect to the Parkinson’s patients. Each participant repeated the sustained phonation of the five Spanish vowels three times and those utterances per speaker are modeled by using phonation and articulation features. Feature selection is applied to eliminate redundant information in the features space, and the automatic discrimination of the three groups of speakers is performed using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) following a one vs. all strategy, speaker independent. The results are compared to those obtained using a cognitive-inspired classifier which is based on neural networks (NN). The results indicate that the phonation and articulation capabilities of young speakers clearly differ from those exhibited by the elderly speakers (with and without PD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper introducing experimental evidence to support the fact that age matching is necessary to perform more accurate and robust evaluations of pathological speech signals, especially considering diseases suffered by elderly people, like Parkinson’s. Additionally, the comparison among groups of speakers at different ages is necessary in order to understand the natural change in speech due to the aging process.","tags":null,"title":"Parkinson's disease and aging: analysis of their effect in phonation and articulation of speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Jiménez-Monsalve","Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Pedro Gomez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"eca1ff7d1138cb7199d1491d294ce707","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/jimenez-2017-phonation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.787436Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jimenez-2017-phonation/","section":"publication","summary":"This study considers phonation and articulation measures to model voice disorders produced by three different pathologies: Laryngeal pathologies (LP), cleft lip and palate (CLP), and Parkinson’s disease (PD).

This research work aims in the development of a methodology for the automatic emotion recognition from speech signals in non-controlled noise conditions. For that purpose, different sets of acoustic, non-linear, and wavelet based features are used to characterize emotions in different databases created for such purpose. The acoustic analysis considers a standard feature set developed for emotion recognition from speech called OpenEAR, and a set of spectral and noise derived measures.  The non-linear analysis is based on non-linear dynamic measures and include the correlation dimension, the largest Lyapunov exponent, the Hurst exponent, and the Lempel Ziv complexity. Also it is proposed a set of measures derived from parametric non-stationary analysis using time dependent ARMA models. The wavelet based measures consider features derived from the wavelet packet transform, and different wavelet time-frequency representations such as the bionic wavelet transform, and the synchro-squeezed wavelet transform. Different non-controlled noise conditions are tested considering four different scenarios: (1) the original recordings, (2) the signals degraded by two additive noisy environments: street and a cafeteria babble, (3) the re-captured signals in two natural noisy environments asstreet and office, and (4) the recordings compressed by seven different codecs used for the transmission through mobile, VoIP, and web based telephone channels.

Regarding the automatic monitoring of the neurological state, the proposed approach could be used as complement of other features derived from speech or other bio-signals to monitor the neurological state of the patients.","tags":null,"title":"Word accuracy and dynamic time warping to assess intelligibility deficits in patients with parkinsons disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Tomas Arias-Vergara","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Julián D Arias-Londoño","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"7f4970f463cc5b89985ef31095396033","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2015-automatic/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.358998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2015-automatic/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic classification of Parkinson's disease (PD) speakers and healthy controls (HC) is performed considering speech recordings collected in non-controlled noise conditions. The speech tasks include six sentences and a read text. The recording is performed using an open source portable device and a commercial microphone. A speech enhancement (SE) technique is applied to improve the quality of the signals. Voiced and unvoiced frames are segmented from the speech tasks and characterized separately. The discrimination of speakers with PD and HC is performed using a support vector machine with soft margin. The results indicate that it is possible to discriminate between PD and HC speakers using recordings collected in non-controlled noise conditions. The accuracies obtained with the voiced features range from 64% to 86%. For unvoiced features the accuracies range from 78% to 99%. The SE algorithm improves the accuracies of the unvoiced frames in up to 11 percentage points, while the accuracies decrease in the voiced frames when the SE algorithm is applied. This work is a step forward to the development of portable devices to assess the speech of people with PD.

Some of the most relevant proposed applications of it are in call-centers. In these scenarios the speech is distorted by compression algorithms. The effects of such distortion on the performance of systems for automatic recognition of emotions must be assessed. In this study these effects are evaluated independently of any other distortions generated by the communications channel. Several state-of-the-art codecs are used to compress the speech signals of two emotional speech databases. The databases used are the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech and the enterface05. The methodology considers voiced and unvoiced segments of the speech separately. Spectral, cepstral, noise and Non-Linear Dynamics (NLD) measures are used to characterize the segments. Finally, a classifier based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to identify the emotion. The results indicate that voiced segments are less affected by the compression than unvoiced ones in terms in classification accuracy. They also show that the bandwidth of the analyzed signals is an important factor in the classification results.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic emotion recognition in compressed speech using acoustic and non-linear features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Nicanor Garcı́a","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"bcfe1a1d89bc5c95c3ec359e528dddb9","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2015-emotion/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.360692Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2015-emotion/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic emotion recognition considering speech signals has attracted the attention of the research community in the last years. One of the main challenges is to find suitable features to represent the affective state of the speaker. In this paper, a new set of features derived from the wavelet packet transform is proposed to classify different negative emotions such as anger, fear, and disgust, and to differentiate between those negative emotions and neutral state, or positive emotions such as happiness. Different wavelet decompositions are considered both for voiced and unvoiced segments, in order to determine a frequency band where the emotions are concentrated. Several measures are calculated in the wavelet decomposed signals, including log-energy, entropy measures, mel frequency cepstral coefficients, and the Lempel-Ziv complexity. The experiments consider two different databases extensively used in emotion recognition: the Berlin emotional database, and the enterface05 database. Also, in order to approximate to real-world conditions in terms of the quality of recorded speech, such databases are degraded using different environmental noise such as cafeteria babble, and street noise. The addition of noise is performed considering several signal to noise ratio levels which range from -3 to 6 dB. Finally, the effect produced by two different speech enhancement methods is evaluated. According to results, the features calculated from the lower frequency wavelet decomposition coefficients are able to recognize the fear-type emotions in speech. Also, one of the speech enhancement algorithms has proven to be useful to improve of the accuracy in cases of speech signals affected by highly background noise.","tags":null,"title":"Emotion recognition from speech under environmental noise conditions using wavelet decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián D Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","LD Avendaño","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"0bbbba9fb117f660bc63f8cc01d2d238","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2015-time/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:58:03.788536Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2015-time/","section":"publication","summary":"The speech signals are non-stationary processes with changes in time and frequency. The structure of a speech signal is also affected by the presence of several paralinguistics phenomena such as emotions, pathologies, cognitive impairments, among others. Non-stationarity can be modeled using several parametric techniques. A novel approach based on time dependent auto-regressive moving average (TARMA) is proposed here to model the non-stationarity of speech signals. The model is tested in the recognition of “fear-typeo” emotions in speech. The proposed approach is applied to model syllables and unvoiced segments extracted from recordings of the Berlin and enterface05 databases.

F0 estimation can be used to separate two kind of frames from an utterance, those where the vocal folds vibrate (voiced sounds) and those where not (unvoiced sounds). The methods used to estimate F0 are affected by the presence of additive noise in recordings made in non-controlled environments, however, there are different techniques to mitigate the effect of such noise and Speech Enhancement (SE) has proven to be one of the most effective ones. This article presents results of the evaluation of the effects of noise and SE algorithms on the detection of F0 and the signal segmentation in voiced/unvoiced segments. We performed experiments with signals artificially contaminated with two different kinds of noise, White Gaussian Noise (WGN) and background noise recorded at a cafeteria (Cafeteria babble), subsequently, the signals are processed with SE algorithms of four different classes: Wiener Filter, Spectral Subtraction, Statistical-Model Based and Sub-space algorithms. Two different kind of error metrics are considered: Gross Pitch Error and Voicing Determination Error. The results show that only the sub-space approach improves the performance in the detection of F0 and the signal segmentation in voiced/unvoicd segments.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of the effects of speech enhancement algorithms on the detection of fundamental frequency of speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Nicanor Garcı́a","Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Olga Lucia Quintero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"c8962d3a43c09ade58ab6fdcd5fc7cb1","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2014-evaluation/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.361329Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2014-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"Detection of emotion in humans from speech signals is a recent research field. One of the scenarios where this field has been applied is in situations where the human integrity and security are at risk. In this paper we are propossing a set of features based on the Teager energy operator, and several entropy measures obtained from the decomposition signals from discrete wavelet transform to characterize different types of negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, disgust, and desperation. The features are measured in three different conditions: (1) the original speech signals, (2) the signals that are contaminated with noise, or are affected by the presence of a phone channel, and (3) the signals that are obtained after processing using an algorithm for Speech Enhancement based on Karhunen-Love Transform. According to the results, when the speech enhancement is applied, the detection of emotion in speech is increased in up to 22% compared to results obtained when the speech signal is highly contaminated with noise.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of wavelet measures on automatic detection of emotion in noisy and telephony speech signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco Arroyave","Julián David Arias-Londoño","Jesús Francisco Vargas Bonilla","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"eac1987cf736406509a439a47d3e8d9c","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2014-new/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.357808Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2014-new/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the coordination of muscles and limbs, including those responsible of the speech production. The lack of control ofthe limbs and muscles involved in the speech production process can generate intelligibility problems and this situation has a negative impact in the social interaction of the patients. It is already demonstrated that constant speech therapy can improve the communication abilities of the patients; however, the measurement of the recovery progress is done subjectively by speech therapists and neurologists. Due to this, it is required the development of flexible tools able to asses and guide the speech therapy of the patients. In this paper the design and deployment of a new device for the real time assessment of speech signals of people with PD is presented. The processes of design and deployment include the development on three platforms: first, a graphic user interface is developed on Matlab, second the first prototype is implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP) and third, the final device is developed on a mini-computer. The device is equipped with an audio codec, storage capacity and the processing unit. Besides, the system is complemented with a monitor to display the processed information on real time and with a keyboard enabling the interaction of the end-user with the device. Different acoustics and nonlinear dynamics measures which have been used in the state of the art for the assessment of speech of people with PD are implemented on the three mentioned platforms. In accordance with the state of the art, the designed platforms show an increment in the variation of the fundamental period of speech (commonly called pitch) of people with PD. Additionally, the decrease of the vocal space area is validated for the case of patients with PD. These results indicate that the designed device is useful to perform the assessment and monitoring of the speech therapy of people with PD.","tags":null,"title":"New computer aided device for real time analysis of speech of people with Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Camilo Vásquez-Correa","Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave","Julian David Arias-Londono","Jesus Francisco Vargas-Bonilla","Elmar Nöth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b428f51d82f9f313cafb9b2239d7180d","permalink":"https://jcvasquezc.github.io/publication/vasquez-2013-design/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T14:57:01.364887Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-2013-design/","section":"publication","summary":"Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the coordination and regulation of muscles and limbs, including those responsible of speech production, resulting alterations in voice intelligibility.
